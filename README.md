# Be a Bee
## Submission for ElleHacks 2023
### Theme: Earth
## Inspiration
With the theme of the four elements (fire, earth, wind, water), we aimed towards nature/environmental topics such as climate change, natural disasters, and endangered species. We also want this project to be educational and involve user interaction. This leads to either a game or chatbot. We then chose to do bumblebees as their population is declining over the years and it is strongly connected to the earth theme, with hopes of learning about bees (or "be a bee").

## What it does
It is a bot that can answer buzzing questions about bumblebees or even share cool facts (and sweet puns) about these critters. You can ask it to generate a bee image or provide an external link to learn more about  them.

## How we built it
We used Autocode and linked it to Google Spreadsheet, Discord, and Stable Diffusion. Then, we gather information on bumblebees and insert it into Autocode by javascript arrays or Google Spreadsheet.

## Challenges we ran into
We switched to too many different platforms throughout this hackathon (either due to not knowing how to implement it or time constant). We started with Unity, then ended up with a Discord bot. 

When we tried Autocode, we realized that the free version is limited to one link per API service. Removing the discord bot from the developer portal takes a day for Autocode to find out that the bot does not exist anymore. We were stuck until we created another new Autocode account to add the new Discord bot. We had planned a great idea on making some RPG game about bumblebees but we sadly already used Google Spreadsheet on the Q&A section (cannot link more than one spreadsheet). There was also a sharing issue but it was resolved when sharing with one account (as sharing with multiple accounts is subscription based). 

~~Half of our team no show~~
~~Did this 3 am~~
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We made a functional Discord bot that can interact with users in the server.

## What we learned
We learned basic javascript and the different APIs. We also understand that teamwork is crucial and bumblebees are cool.

## What's next?
We could add a small gallery of the different species of bumblebees and a calendar of upcoming events regarding bee conservation. This would encourage users to attend these workshops and practice environmental stewardship.
